# TalentFlow

TalentFlow is an HR management frontend application that allows teams to manage jobs, candidates, and assessments. The app uses a **simulated backend** via **MSW** and **Dexie (IndexedDB)** to persist data locally.

## üü¶ Jobs Flow

The **Jobs Flow** in TalentFlow allows HR teams to manage job postings efficiently. Even though this is a frontend-only app, a **simulated backend** is implemented using **MSW** and **Dexie (IndexedDB)** to persist data locally.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Simulation

- **Database:**  
  - `JobsDB` (Dexie) with a `jobs` table storing job details.  
  - Each job has:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "job-1",
      "title": "Frontend Developer",
      "slug": "frontend-developer-1a2b",
      "status": "active",
      "tags": ["React", "JavaScript"],
      "order": 0,
      "description": "Job description text...",
      "requirements": ["Req1", "Req2"],
      "salary": "$50K - $120K",
      "location": "City, State",
      "jobType": "Full-time",
      "createdAt": "2024-05-20T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
    ```

- **Seed Data:**  
  - 25 jobs generated using Faker with realistic titles, tags, and locations.  
  - Mixed `active` and `archived` statuses.

- **MSW Handlers (Endpoints):**  
  - `GET /jobs` ‚Äì fetch list with pagination, filters, search  
  - `GET /jobs/:id` ‚Äì fetch single job details  
  - `POST /jobs` ‚Äì create a new job  
  - `PATCH /jobs/:id` ‚Äì edit job  
  - `PATCH /jobs/:id/reorder` ‚Äì reorder jobs (optimistic updates with rollback)  
  - `DELETE /jobs/:id` ‚Äì remove job

- **Latency & Error Simulation:**  
  - Artificial delay: **200‚Äì1200ms** using `delay()`  
  - Random errors on write operations (~8% chance) using `maybeFail()`  
  - Simulated network errors (timeout, server overload, internal error)

- **Persistence:**  
  - All job data stored in **IndexedDB** via Dexie.  
  - State is restored automatically on page refresh.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Features

1. **Jobs List**  
   - Displays jobs with pagination, search, and filters (status, job type).  
   - Drag-and-drop to reorder jobs with **optimistic UI updates**.

2. **Job Create / Edit**  
   - Create or edit via a modal or route.  
   - Validations: **title required**, **unique slug**.

3. **Archive / Unarchive Jobs**  
   - Toggle between `active` and `archived` status.  
   - Archived jobs visually distinguished.

4. **Delete Job**  
   - Delete confirmation modal prevents accidental removal.

5. **Deep Linking**  
   - `/jobs/:id` shows **job details** including:  
     - Description  
     - Requirements  
     - Tags  
     - Job type, location, salary  
     - Number of applications (fetched from candidates)  
   - Manage candidates button navigates to `/jobs/:id/candidates`.

6. **Reordering Jobs**  
   - Drag-and-drop implemented using `onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, `onDrop`.  
   - Backend updates order via `/jobs/:id/reorder` endpoint.  
   - Rollback occurs on simulated API failure.

7. **UI/UX**  
   - Clean Tailwind CSS styling with hover states, animations, and responsive design.  
   - Empty state messages for no jobs matching filters.  
   - Pagination controls with previous/next and page numbers.

## üü¶ Candidate Flow

The **Candidate Flow** in TalentFlow allows HR teams to manage applicants and track their progress across job stages. Like Jobs Flow, it uses **MSW** and **Dexie** for frontend simulation and persistence.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Simulation

- **Database:**  
  - `CandidatesDB` (Dexie) with a `candidates` table storing candidate details.  
  - Each candidate has:

    ```json
    {

      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+1234567890",
      "jobId": "job-1",
      "stage": "Applied",
      "notes": [
        {
          "id": "note-1",
          "text": "Candidate referred by Jane",
          "mentions": ["Jane Doe"],
          "createdAt": "2024-05-21T10:00:00.000Z"
        }
      ],
      "resume": "link/to/resume.pdf",
      "appliedAt": "2024-05-20T12:30:00.000Z"
    }
    ```

  - `DELETE /candidates/:id` ‚Äì remove candidate

- **Latency & Error Simulation:**  
  - Artificial delay: **150‚Äì1000ms**  
  - Random write errors (~10% chance)  
  - Simulated network errors (timeout, internal error)

- **Persistence:**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Simulation

- **Database:**  
  - `AssessmentsDB` (Dexie) storing assessments linked to jobs.  
  - Each assessment contains:

    ```json
